# MissionControl
Windows based software for flying drones (currently supports the Parrot Bepop drone)

This is a program to fly drones with your Windows PC. It supports many different input types, although changing the bindings requires editing the code. I was planning on polishing this up more before relasing it (e.g. a UI to configure inputs, etc.) but unfortunately someone broke into my house and stole my drone, so you're getting it as it is :p.

Using MissionControl
--------------------
To use MissionControl you will need an XBox 360 controller (unless you changed the bindings in InputManager.cs). Connect to the drone's WiFi network and press F5 to start flying!
